# LeapMotionQCPlugIn

This is a simple proof-of-concept Quartz Composer plugin exposing input data from a [Leap Motion](https://leapmotion.com/) device. The project is a demo part of [CocoaHeads Kraków](http://meetup.com/CocoaHeads-Krakow/) presentation on Quartz Composer prepared by [Błażej Biesiada](https://twitter.com/_bejo).

## Setup

[Leap Motion SDK](http://developer.leapmotion.com/) is not attached to this project since it is not public yet. If you have access to the development kit all you need to do is to place it in _LeapSDK_ directory.
